# Shop

üõçÔ∏è Just finished my latest project - a custom shop developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Taking a step back to revisit and reinforce skills learned long ago was both nostalgic and rewarding. Plus, I wanted a comprehensive JavaScript project under my belt. There's a high chance this project will soon find its way to my portfolio at https://alihoushangi.ir/.

Here's a sneak peek into what I've been practicing:

Basic API interaction for fetching and displaying data
Utilizing LocalStorage for seamless user experiences
Form validation to ensure data integrity
And more exciting JavaScript functionalities!
I'd greatly appreciate your likes on my repository. Also, if you know someone hunting for a talented Frontend developer, feel free to make an introduction!
